# About

A simple portfolio website created as coursework for an early component of the Coder Academy bootcamp.

# Features and technology

The site was created using pure html and CSS (and a small amount of vanilla JavaScript) without the use of any libraries or frameworks. It features a landing page, "About Me", an overview of past projects and (mainly due to assessment requirements) a non-functional contact form and blog page with placeholder content. CSS Grid, Flexbox and media breakpoints are used to create a responsive layout.
